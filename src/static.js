As technology schools are not active in giving a good social media appearance and brand development, influencers would doubt how relevant this is. Will their audience has any use for this?         However, our team found and convinced some great influencers whose audience found our client’s technology school apt for their further education. Since previously paid ads weren’t doing well, we thought of coming up with new ideas, and they worked successfully.",
